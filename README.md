# eos_flash_cards

This is a basic command line program written to gain experience writing
python. 

Currently only a flash card game, but I have plans to expand some.

run from command line with
    python3 ./eosflashcards
    
uses f strings so you need a newer python.

The game itself quizes the user on their knowledge of 
ETC Eos lighting terminology. Currently only utilizes a small
dictionary, but I hope to have the full Eos glossary fed in
sootn.
