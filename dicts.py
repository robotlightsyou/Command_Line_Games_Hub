test = {'Absolute Data': 'Absolute data is the term denoting that a parametere has been established manual control, rather than a palette, preset, or cue.',
           'Absolute Effect': 'Am absolute effect provides a list of sequential actions channels are to take.',
           'Active': 'A term defining a luminaire with intensity greater than 0. Also, a cue currently in use on a playback fader or submaster is considered active.',
           'Assert': 'An attribute that can be applied to a selected channel, parameter, cue, or cue part that forces the replay of tracked values.'}





EOSDICT = {'Auto-Mark': 'The act of automatically presetting lights (also known as Move While Dark or Move Before Bright).  Auto-Marks are trigger when intensity is fading from zero to an active level, and the channels associated non-intensity parameters (NIPs) have move instructions.  The NIPS will actually preset in the previous cue.  Auto-Mark is a setup option.  When enabled, it may be disabled on a per cue or cue part basis, enabling live moves.',
'Axis': 'The axis of a relative effect applies to associated focus data, and will perform a weighted transformation on the pattern to skew its shape.',
'Back/Go Back': 'The fader button that fades the active cue to the previous stage state. Subsequent use of the Back button from that point goes sequentially back through the cue sheet.',
'Background State': 'The state a parameter is in, as determined by the contributions of faders and submasters, without the contribution of manual control.    If there is no data from the playbacks, the background state is the channel’s default value, as drawn from library data.',
'Balance Mode': 'In Congo, the console may be placed in balance mode to select individual channels and verify their settings. In Balance mode, unselected channels are forced to zero intensity. You cannot record while balance mode is active.',
'Beam Palette': 'Beam palettes are referenced data and can include all beam parameters (gobos, effects, edge, etc). In Eos, a number of default beam palettes will be created based on the patterns and effects available from the fixtures in the rig, as determined by that fixture’s library. Beam palettes can store data on a per channel basis.   Custom beam palettes may be created.  Beam palette data is referenced into presets and cues.',
'Blind Editing': 'The editing mode in which the actions taken are recorded to the required channels or parameters, but are not executed on stage.   Blind views typically include single record targets at a time. Spreadsheet views are always blind.',

'Browser': 'A menu tree that accesses system displays, functions, utilities, file maintenance and record targets.',
'Captured Parameters': 'Manually set parameters can be placed in a captured state with the [Capture] button.  Captured parameters are essentially independent.  They will not respond to any playback control when in a captured state.  Captured parameters differ from parked parameters in that their current setting will be stored to record targets, appropriate to the target being stored. Captured parameters can be uncaptured, or released , remaining at their current setting.  When captured intensity is released, in Congo it will fade or snap to the playback that would otherwise control that channel. Captured channels/parameters will respond to manual control actions.',
'Channel': 'A channel is an identifier for one entire multiple parameter device, or it can be an identifier for multiple single parameter devices (dimmers, for example).   It is a number applied as a function of patch.',
'Channel Check': 'A feature that allows a channel intensity to be set, and then modified by the channel check command.  In Eos, pressing [Next] returns the selected channel to its former value and sets the next channel to the same intensity as the previous channel. Channel  check may be used in combination with [Last] as well.',
'Channel Filter': 'Each playback fader may be assigned a channel filter, which allows only the channels selected at the point the channel filter is deployed to be enabled on that fader.  Channel filters are applied and removed in the fader display.',
'Channel Layouts': 'The channel layout is a graphical representation of the plot, either for the entire show, or for specific acts/scenes or channel groupings, based on the preference of the designer/operator.  Channel layouts may also contain other console data, such as palettes, groups, sequences and dynamic effects.',
'Channel Editor Wizard': 'The wizard used to affect changes upon selected channels throughout a sequence or a selected range of steps or presets. Options in the wizard include settings a specific level, increasing or decreasing recorded levels by a percentage or set number of points, setting a minimum or maximum intensity level, swapping and copying levels from one channel to others. This wizard affects only intensity for selected channels.',
'Channel Time Groups': 'Within a sequence step, groups of channels may be assigned discrete intensity fade and delay times. There is no limit to the number of time groups you may have in a step.',
'Chase Wizard': 'The wizard used to automate the creation of presets and a sequence to create a stepped intensity effect.',
'Color': 'A function of the luminaire specified by hue and saturation values, CMY (cyan, magenta, yellow) or RBG (red, blue, green).',
'Color Palettes': 'Color Palettes are referenced data that can only include color values. In Eos, a number of default color palettes will be created based on the colors available from the fixtures in the rig, as determined by that fixture’s library.   Color palettes may store discrete settings on a per channel basis.  Custom color palettes may be created, using absolute data set manually by the user, or in Eos created from the HS color picker or matched to popular gel colors.',
'[Control] Parameters': 'Dynamically controlled attributes of a device that can be manually adjusted and stored in show data, for example, intensity, iris, color, focus, etc.',
'Cross fade': 'When a cue is programmed as a crossfade, any affected values are faded from their current setting (regardless of the source) to their new destination in the incoming cue.  Any values not provided a move instruction in the incoming cue are left at their current settings.',
'Cue': 'In Eos, a cue is a collection of information about a programmed event that can be played back on any fader. 10,000 cues can be recorded, numbered from .01 to 9999.99. In Congo, a cue is a concept, not a record target. A cue in Congo is the event that occurs when a Preset is played back by a Sequence Step.',
'Cue Attributes': 'Cue attributes are information programmed in association with a given cue number and may be easily changed without re-recording or updating the cue.  Cue attributes include IFCB level timing, labels and notes, links to other cues, macros, snapshots, follow or hang times and hold instructions, etc.',
'Cue List': 'A cue list is a sequence of cues including all cue attributes. A cue list may be assigned to a playback fader and may be executed by links within other cue lists.',
'Cue List Index': 'The Cue List Index is a blind mode display that provides a quick reference to all cue lists stored in the show.  Independent and LTP/HTP intensity settings are established in the cue list index.  Individual cue lists may be accessed and cue attributes changed without impacting the Live Playback Status display.  99 cue lists may be created.',
'Cue Only': 'When [Cue Only] is deployed, any changes made to the cue list from a new cue record action or from a cue modification will not impact subsequent cues.  Cue Only (the alternative of Track) is a desk default, which can be overridden for specific record actions using [Track/Cue Only]. Track may be used in conjunction with Record, Record Only and Update and only impacts cues.',
'Cue Sheet': 'A display that provides a sequential listing of cues, all assigned attributes and perhaps images, or links to images.  The Cue Sheet indicates cue status (active or inactive).  The Cue Sheet is also reflective of live mode operations in that the display will be oriented around the last activated cue.  The Cue Sheet is part of the Playback Status Display.',
'Curve': 'A graph of light output plotted against the value of a channel parameter. Curves can be used to compensate for non-linear response of channels (fixtures) or to override the default response behavior of them. 100 curves can be provided, for use with internal or external dimmers in patch. In patch, a curve represents the intensity output curve.  A curve of zero (the default) allows the luminaire to follow the curve resident in the electronic dimmer or mechanical device.  The user shall be allowed to create additional curves, which can be assigned in patch (and is deployed in Curves can also be applied to a cue or cue part.',
'Default Value': 'A channels default value represents the position it will assume when the rig is activated, without the benefit of any manual control or playback instruction.   The default value can also be called “Home”.  For example, a dimmers default value is “out.” Pan and tilt are often set with a default value of 50/50.  Iris often has a default value of Full.  Default values may be modified in patch.',
'Delay Time': 'An attribute associated with a parameter transition. A delay time may be applied to the up or down intensity transition or to any other parameter transition on a channel basis.   In all instances, delay times will begin to count from the moment the associated cue or cue part [Eos] or Preset [Congo] is executed.  Delay may also be applied at a cue or cue part [Eos] or preset [Congo] level for each parameter category.',
'Delete': 'An action that allows record targets (cues, presets, palettes, effects, etc) to be deleted.',
'Device': 'any multi-parameter or non-intensity device patched in Congo. A scroller is a device. A moving light is a device.',
'Device Controls': 'A set of softkeys in Congo specifically for the functions of Lamp On, Lamp Off and Lamp Reset.',
'Dimmer Curve': 'A graph of light output plotted against the value of a channel parameter. Curves can be used to compensate for non-linear response of channels (fixtures) or to override the default response behavior of them. Dimmer Curves are applied in the Output List. There are 10 dimmer curved provided, and the user may create his own.',
'Direct Selects': 'Direct selects provide “one touch” recall of various targets. In Eos: channels, groups, palettes, presets, effects, macros and snapshots. In Congo: groups, palettes, dynamic effects, screen views, Autogroups.',
'Douse': 'To kill a lamp in an arc luminaire.  Douse is unrelated to intensity states.',
'Down Fade Time': 'A timing value associated with channel intensity settings.  The Down Fade Time affects the intensity transition in the event the transition is in a downward direction.  The Down Fade time may have an associated delay time.  The down fade time may be applied at a cue or cue part level, or may be applied at the individual channel level.',
'Dynamic Effects': 'Dynamic effects define shapes by applying offsets to parameter settings.',
'Edge': 'In a wash luminaire, the spot or flood range of the diffusion mechanism(s). In a spot luminaire, edge defines the hardness or softness of the beam edge.',
'Fade Curve': 'A graph of cue output (intensity only) plotted against the progress through a crossfade. Fade curves are applied in the Sequence List. No default curves are provided – the user can create their own as needed.',
'Fade within Fade': 'A playback concept that indicates a channel parameter will continue fading to a cue destination, even if a different cue is recalled, provided that channel parameter does not have a move instruction in the new cue.  Eos is inherently a fade within fade system. In Congo, you can store sequence steps as movefades or lockfades to achieve this behavior for intensities. As a default, parameters will behave in this way.',
'Fader': 'In Eos, a fader can be defined as a playback, a grand master or a submaster. Fader information shall be displayed on the facepanel.  Information about the fader shall include pending cue number, active cue number, remaining time in the cue (as calculated by the parameter event that will complete last), a count down of an associated follow or hang time, filter states, independent control and the rate override, if any.',
'Fetch': 'Fetch allows the specified parameter information for selected channels to be recalled live or in blind from recorded preset data. Fetch is essentially a “copy from” instruction and is used in conjunction with the attribute or parameter (wheel) keys. # FETCH & FOCUS will recall the recorded focus settings for selected channels from the preset #.',
'Filters': 'Filters may be placed on any of the faders during playback to enable only associated parameters on that fader; playback of other (non-filtered) parameters is disabled.    Filters are also provided for cue, preset and palette recording.    If a record target is stored with a filter in place, the filter allows associated parameter data to be recorded in the target, providing all other parameter data with null values.    Current filter settings are ignored during palette and preset replay and cue/preset update commands, but are followed in [Recall] operations.  Assignment of filters to faders is a manual attribute.  Applied fader filters take effect on the next cue recall if the fader is a playback. Since submasters control intensity only, filters cannot be applied to them.',
'Fixture Controls': 'Commonly, fixture functions such as strike or douse the lamp or calibration are accessed from a control channel, which must be set to an obtuse combination of values to achieve the desired result.  In Eos, these functions are all normalized into Fixture Controls.  To calibrate a fixture, select the associated channel, access fixture controls and then [Calibrate].',
'Flip': 'A live mode command that turns a moving head luminaire to achieve the same focus position from the opposite pan/tilt settings.',
'Focus Palettes': 'A collection of referenced position points in the space.  In Eos, default focus palettes can be constructed based on grid creation or defining focus points. Custom palettes can be created.  Palettes are referenced data.  If their contents change, the net result of any associated cues, effects or presets are affected accordingly.',
'Follow/Followon Time': 'A follow time is an attribute that can be applied to a cue causing the next cue to be automatically executed after the follow time has elapsed.  The follow time will begin counting down the moment the associated cue is executed. (Eos: see Hang Time). At the moment, in Congo, this timing is set globally as either followon or wait timing.',
'Form': 'Constraints placed on pan or tilt to adjust the axis and shape of a dynamic effect. (In Eos, form is also a sub-category in Beam containing parameters that affect the quality of the beam: iris, edge, zoom, etc.)',
'Go In B': 'In Congo, this means that parameter moves for a given preset will occur when that preset is loaded into the B fader (the pending cue) rather than when Go is pressed for that preset. If Go In B is the default when presets are initially recorded, Congo will attempt to add instructions at the channel level for Go In B to more accurately play presets back as you intend.',
'Grand Master': 'Grand Masters proportionally inhibit associated channels intensity output. Grand Masters differ from inhibitive submasters in that their impact is not stored into record targets.',
'Grid': 'A grid is a set of rows and columns in each focus plane such that the user can specify a desired point in space by entering the focus plane number, and the row/column. The user determines how many rows and columns are in each grid.',
'Groups': 'A group is a collection of channels.  Groups are stored in the order channels were selected when the group was recorded. Eos groups do not contain any intensity information, Congo groups do.',
'Group List': 'A blind mode display showing all groups, their label and channel order. Controls are provided to modify the contents individual groups and to quickly change their channel order.',
'Hang Time': 'A hang time (an alternative to setting follow time) is an attribute that can be applied to a cue causing the next cue to be automatically executed after the hang time has elapsed.  The hang time will begin counting down the moment the associated cue is complete.',
'Highlight': 'Highlight is a manual control function that sets selected channels to a previously established user-defined value, allowing those luminaires to be quickly identified.  For example, a common highlight setting is Intensity Full, Open Color and Open Frame.',
'Hold': 'A cue attribute that allows the playback potentiometer to master intensity even when the cue has finished its transition.',
'Home': 'The act of setting a luminaire  to its default value is often called “homing” it.',
'Import Wizard': 'The import wizard allows the user to selectively import data from another play or import text into the channel database from a text file into the current play.',
'In Sequence': 'A cue is run in sequence if it was loaded on a playback fader automatically as a result of running the previous cue on that fader (see Out of Sequence).',
'In Time': 'The time set to a sequence step that corresponds to the look fading into the A fader. In effect, the In Time affects the intensity transition of channels fading to a higher level.  The In Time may have an associated delay time. In Time is used as the base value for Relative (percentage) Times.',
'Independent': 'A state a fader can be placed in which prohibits its contents from responding to other fader instructions (but allowing manual control override).  Releasing the fader from its independent state (it becomes non-independent) makes the associated channels/parameters available to other control.  Those parameters will respond to the next available instruction for which they have recorded data.  The intensity levels for channels on independent faders are affected by the setting of the grand master or condition of the blackout button. If there is more than one playback or submaster in independent mode, they have equal priority.',
'Independents': 'The six rotary faders and three switches on the Congo console that can be used for special purposes – houselights, worklights, smoke machines, etc. These special faders/switches can be used in inclusive (shared control with the rest of the console), exclusive (independent control from the rest of the console) or inhibitive operation (acting as masters for their content).',
'Inhibitive submaster': 'inhibitive submasters do not contribute levels themselves, they serve only as a proportional master for intensity settings provided by other playbacks. They do not provide stage output; they only allow stage output.  Inhibitive submasters differ from grand masters in that their affect will impact record targets.',
'Lamp Check ': 'The mode that allows the operator to sequentially step through each luminaire in the system, wherein each luminaire executes a full pan operation, full tilt operation and steps through each of its other functions.  The operator may run the luminaire again, step to the next luminaire or any luminaire in the system.  It will be possible to order the lamp check by means other than numeric selection.',
'Link': 'A cue/step attribute that a changes the order of playback of a cue list or sequence. The automatic activation of the linked cue or step is dependent on the presence of a follow or hang, or followon/wait time.',
'Live': 'The state of the current channel data that is being sent through patch out to the rig. The live view represents the current channel data that is "on stage" (the live output of the system) at the current time.',
'Live Move': 'A live move is anytime intensity is active and a non-intensity parameter takes a move instruction.',
'Load': 'The fader button that takes the selected cue and loads it to the associated fader’s pending file. The load button, combined with Go, can advance the pending file of the associated fader.  The load button, combined with Stop/Back, can decrement the pending file of the associated fader.  The load button, used in combination with other playback controls, places different conditions on the associated fader (such as disable time, apply filters, release the fader, etc)',
'Lockfade Type': 'In Congo, to achieve fade-within-fade operation of intensity levels and continue the fade regardless of the Go Back or Pause keys on the main playback, you must use change the type of crossfade you use. A step set to lockfade, followed by another step set to lockfade, will allow intensity levels that are moving in the first step to continue to fade in that step’s in time, and that fade will continue to its end no matter what (minus exiting the program or disconnecting the console from the network).',
'Loop': 'An attribute that can be added to a cue, indicating the number of times a linked sequence of cues is to execute.',
'Luminaire Timing': 'Some parameters of many moving lights can execute timing instructions.  Essentially, when a luminaire time is used, the system sends the required end state and the time, and the luminaire itself executes its own move, rather than being given incremental position information.   Luminaire timing can be used to smooth out rough (long and slow) transitions.  In Eos, luminaire timing is accessed through the [Time] function, in Congo it is accessed from parameter controls.',
'Macros': 'A collection of context sensitive commands (button presses or display selections) that can be recorded for sequential automated playback, either through manual selection of the associated macro number, or from automated activation through the cue sheet/sequence list.',
'Magic sheet': 'The magic sheet is a graphical or numeric representation of the plot, either for the entire show, or for specific acts/scenes, based on the preference of the designer. Magic sheets are customized for the preferences of the design team.',
'Manual Control': 'Manual control refers to setting parameter data manually, rather than with playback data.  Manual control includes parameter setting with the encoders, palettes, presets or via the spreadsheet, 2D or 3D interfaces.',
'Mark': 'To pre-set non-intensity parameters in one cue for a subsequent cue. See Auto- Mark and Referenced Mark for Eos. For Congo, see Go In B.',
'Master Playbacks': 'The 40 Masters are multipurpose faders that can be assigned any data in the play. Most often used with Presets, Groups and Sequences, you can also assign moving light parameter controls, channel layouts, palettes and dynamic effects. Sequences assigned to one of the Master Playbacks can be connected to the Master Playback controls in the center of the console for more complete control of the sequence.',
'Merge': '(import)  A method of loading a show file that preserves elements of the current show, which will not be replaced by the elements being loaded. For instance “Load Cues” will delete all previously existing cues before adding the cues from the show file.  “Merge Cues” will only delete the cues that will be replaced by the cues in the show file being loaded.',
'Move Fade': 'Eos is a move fade system.  Only move instructions are executed when working in sequence.  Tracked values are ignored.  Out of sequence cues override this behavior, recalling the entire contents of the cue.  Assert is also a means to recall tracked values.',
'Movefade Type': 'In Congo, to achieve fade-within-fade operation of intensity levels, you must use change the type of crossfade you use. A step set to movefade, followed by another step set to movefade, will allow intensity levels that are moving in the first step to continue to fade in that step’s in time. Movefades are affected by the Go Back and Pause keys on the main and master playback.',
'Move Instruction': 'A move instruction is a recorded value that is different from the value in the previous cue.',
'Multipart cues': 'Multipart cues provide a structure in which parameters can be easily divided into subsets for display, attribute assignment, editing and playback.    Defaults can be established, in which parts are automatically created at cue record, or the parts can be established while or after the cue is recorded.  A parameter can only be provided an instruction once in a multipart cue (it isn’t possible to adjust color for channel 1 in part 1 and then provide a different instruction in part 8).   Multipart cues are much like setting discrete timing, but they providing visibility of timing data in the cue sheet.',
'Non-Intensity Parameters (NIPs)': 'Non-intensity parameters are all of the controllable functions of a device, except intensity.',
'Null States': 'A null state is provided for a parameter when that data is either filtered or otherwise withheld from a record command using the [Make Null] command.    Nulled values will continue to respond to manual control and playback instructions.',
'Out Time': 'The time set to a sequence step that corresponds to the look fading out of the A fader. In effect, the Out Time affects the intensity transition of channels fading to a lower level.  The Out time may have an associated delay time.',
'Out of Sequence': 'A cue is run out of sequence if it was loaded on a playback fader by the user, rather than automatically as a result of running the previous cue on that fader, or if is a linked cue or initiated by a Go to Cue instruction (see in sequence).',
'Output': 'A DMX512 channel, or an EDMX channel, or a device parameter in ACN/Net3. Outputs are patched to channels.',
'Output Scale Setting': 'Limits the output level of a dimmer.',
'Palettes': 'Elemental building blocks used to create presets, cues and effects. Palettes contain target settings intensity, focus, color and beam (IFCB).  Palettes are referenced data.  If their contents change, the net result of any associated cues, effects or presets are affected accordingly.',
'Parameter': 'A concept used to describe the controllable function of channels (e.g., intensity, color, beam, edge and so forth).',
'Parameter Category': 'A grouping of common parameter types.  In Eos, these are intensity, focus, color and beam.',
'Park': 'An attribute that can be applied to a channel or a parameter that locks it into its current setting.  When parked, it cannot be altered by any manual control or playback activity.  The parked level is also held out of all record actions.  Grand master control or the blackout button does not affect parked channel intensity settings.  In Eos, it is also possible to provide a scaled intensity value in park.',
'Partitioned Channels/Parameters': 'Partitioned control allows discrete and/or shared manual control and programming of all channels/parameters across multiple programmers, up to a maximum of 12. It is possible to partition control on a non- contiguous channel basis and a non-contiguous parameter basis.   The following levels of partitioning are possible per user. Specific channel(s) with all parameters Specific channel(s) intensity Specific channel(s) color Specific channel focus and beam (all parameters other than color and intensity)',
'Partitioned Playbacks': 'When faders are configured, they may defined as global or local controllers.  When set as global, they will impact all system channels, regardless of channel partitions.  When set as local, they will impact only the channels partitioned to the associated controller.',
'Patch': 'A mechanism by which the programmer assigns an identifying channel number to devices in his system, defines what those devices are and how they are to be addressed by the system.  Proportional patch levels, curves, swap pan/tilt, invert pan, invert tilt and keywords are also assigned in patch.',
'Path': 'Paths are similar to curves, but they can only affect a parameter when it is moving between 2 predictable points (such as a fade from the parameters current level to the level stored in a cue).  It has no effect on a parameter that is at a static level. They only affect a parameter while the parameter is moving toward the end point of the path.  Paths are applied to channel parameter in a cue, and only affect how the channel makes the move in that particular cue.',
'Pause': 'The pause key halts the crossfade on the main or master playback. Press pause or go to resume the crossfade.',
'Pending cue': 'A sequential list of cues associated with a fader.  The cue “in pending” is the next cue to be activated by go (baseball fans, think “on deck”).',
'Persistent Storage': 'In Eos, when power to the console is cycled, faders and manual control surfaces will resume their previous state; all show data that was recorded will be maintained, regardless of whether or not it was archived to hard drive or external media. In Congo, a copy of the last opened play is maintained and offered at startup, or you may begin with a different or new play.',
'Personalities': 'Drawn from library data, personalities define how the system should control the associated luminaire. Certain aspects of the personality may be modified by the user (what colors are in what frames, for example) and custom personalities may be created.',
'Play': 'The Congo show file. The play contains all recorded data in the show.',
'Play Data': 'Play data includes elements specific to the show itself, including patch, groups, palettes, presets, sequences, macros, etc.',
'Playback': 'Also known as a fader or playback fader.  It is the place that cue lists live and can be affected.',
'Playback event': 'A playback event includes execution of cues, effects, macros or snapshots, either manually or via triggers such as the event list, which can include time code or external control.',
'Playback Tab': 'The Playback tab displays the sequence list and indicates the active and pending cue. A timeline view may also be displayed which will display graphically the progress through the crossfade.',
'Preferences': 'Preferences refers to the individual requirements for specific users based on selections in their user profile.  Preferences can include display preferences or front panel defaults, as appropriate.',
'Preheat': 'A preheat instruction can be provided to the intensity profile of any incandescent source.  This assures the intensity for specified luminaires will be set to the preheat level in the cue prior to execution.   Preheat is typically used at a level at or about 5% for large filament incandescent sources.  Preheats are applied via curves/dimmer curves.',
'Presets': 'A collection of channels and their levels that define a specific look. Presets can contain all of the same data of a cue, except timing data.  They are stored exactly the way cues are (following the same rules for Record All, Record Only and filter settings).  A preset may be labeled.  Presets may contain absolute data or palette data. They are referenced and may not be nested. In Eos, Presets are referenced by channels stored in cues. In Congo, the preset is the basic building block of sequences and is, in effect, the cue.',
'Preset Check': 'A function that allows the programmer to step through a selected preset one channel at a time, to verify its parameter information.  At the conclusion of the preset check, all channels are return to their recorded or manually modified position, allowing the preset to be rerecorded if required.',
'Proportional Patch': 'Proportional patch is an intensity offset that can be added to the profile for intensity, either controlled by an external dimmer or internal mechanical dimmer. If the patch limit is set at 90% (for example), the actual output will always be 10% lower than the specified intensity parameter, as impacted by the various output masters.',
'Query': 'Query is a function allowing the user to question their rig and show file about current values, possible values or impossible values.  Query can be used in conjunction with patch keywords, direct selects and command line actions.  Softkeys are provided to narrow down query states to:  Is In, Isn’t In, Could Be and Can’t Be.',
'Range Editing': 'The editing mode provided for modifying parameter data and timing information.   This allows information to be modified across a number of cues, by specifying the commands to be taken and the range of cues these should be applied to. Cue attributes may also be modified in this manner as well.',
'Recall (n)': '[Recall] allows the specified parameter information for selected channels to be recalled live or in blind from recorded cue data, as modified by the function filters.   Recall is essentially a “copy from” instruction.  Recall can also be used as a verb – as in “to recall a preset” or “recall a cue.”  This is an important distinction to understand, as filter settings impact the noun differently than the verb.',
'Record': 'A button on the control keypad that is used to initiate record actions for all programmable record targets.',
'Record Only': 'A feature used to initiate record actions for cues, presets, palettes and submasters.  Record Only stores only manual parameter data, except as modified by the function filters, and using all of the other rules for selective storing.',
'Record Target': 'Refers to any show data that can be stored by the user, including cues, palettes, presets, groups, snapshots, macros, etc.',
'Referenced Mark': 'Referenced marks can be set from the current live state, indicating the channels to mark and what cue to mark them in.  Referenced marks are effectively a “backwards” track instruction. See Mark.',
'Relative Effects': 'Relative effects provide offset instructions to the current value around which channels are to be set.  The alternatives are:  absolute effects, which provide a sequential list of specific values or step effects, which provide on and off states for channel lists.',
'Relative Time': 'Times for attributes and parameters may be entered as percentages of the In Time of the step. For example, a focus time of 100% means that the pan and tilt parameters will move in whatever time is set for the In Time of that step. A focus time of 50% means that the pan and tilt parameters will move in half of the In Time for that step.',
'Selected Channels': 'A channel or group of channels that respond to manual control are considered selected.  Channels are selected from the keypad, the direct selects, from group selection, or from 2D or 3D displays. When channels are selected, their parameters can be modified by a variety of means.  Selected channels are clearly indicated.',
'Selected Cue': 'The last cue used, modified or stored in live.  The selected cue has an impact in several areas.  First, it determines what cue is recorded if no cue number is specified during a record action. Additionally, when cue blind mode is entered from live, the recorded contents of the selected cue are displayed.  When the [Load] button associated with a playback is pressed, the selected cue is loaded to the pending file of that fader.',
'Sequence': 'A listing of steps containing references to presets for playback. Each step may contain crossfade timing (In/Out), crossfade delays, followon/wait timing, Go On Go/Go In B settings,  channel times, master links, fade curve, link to another step, timecode stamp, notes and a block tracking flag. Sequences may run in normal mode or in chase mode. In normal mode, a step 0 (fade to black) is assumed and is played back when using Go to loop back to step 1 from the last step in the sequence. In chase mode, there is no step 0 and the sequence loops directly from the last step to the first step. You may also modify a chase sequence with a direction setting: bounce, reverse or single shot.',
'Sequence List': 'The blind editor for a sequence.',
'Sequences List': 'The list of all sequences in a play.',
'Seq+ and Seq-': 'Controls on the main playback to move forward and backward through the sequence without crossfade timing.',
'Show Control': 'The system will interface to MIDI, SMPTE and other external triggers. Additional information is available from John Huntington’s book.',
'Show Data': 'Show data includes elements specific to the show itself, including cues, palettes, presets, macros, effects, snapshots, etc.',
'Show File': 'The Eos system is able to both store and retrieve all applicable show data to this single transportable file.',
'Show Library': 'As instances of fixtures and accessories from the fixture library are created and added to the show, references to the elements (within the fixture library) are created and put into the show library. These references are included with other parameters to create unique “personalities”. The “personalities” are data associated with a particular show.',
'Show Playback': 'Execution of recorded show data, either manually or through automated triggers.',
'Sneak': 'The feature that allows manual control values  to be staged and then recalled in a specified time or default manual timing.  Sneak is also used to restore manual values to their background state (aka, cue data or default).',
'Soft Selects': 'Each console\'s user configurable array of buttons (physical or virtual) which provide rapid selection ability from paged lists of data types such as macros, groups, palettes, presets cues, groups, and channels. Ex: A single button press [Group 121] in place of typing [Group] [1] [2] [1].',
'Speed': 'Timing transition information can be absolute (move from A to B in 5 seconds) or relative, indicating rate of change.  Rate of change is analogous to miles per hour (speed). Luminaire speed is accessed under [Time].',
'Spreadsheet Views': 'A view available for all record targets with the record targets on one axis and the channels on the other. Intensity and parameters may be viewed simultaneously. Levels may be edited across targets, and the view may be modified by flexichannel settings.',
'Start': 'An action that energizes a lamp in an arc luminaire.  In Eos, this feature is accessed under Fixture Controls.',
'Start (master)': 'Command that will move a master playback’s fader to a level electronically, or virtually. # START & MASTER KEY will set the output of a master to the fader level # without having to physically move the fader.',
'Step Effects': 'Step effects (very similar to our existing effects packages) provide on and off states and a channel list per each step.  Alternative are:  absolute effects, which provide a sequential list of actions channels are to take or relative effects, which provide offset behavior to the current value.',
'Stop/Back': 'The button immediately stops all playback of a cue when pressed.  Pressing the button again will backup to the previous stage state.   Pressing [Go] resumes the cue activity.  The Stop/Back button, when the fader has been configured as a submaster, acts as a [Solo].',
'Submaster': 'Setting a fader to act as a submaster allows a predetermined set of channels to have their intensities controlled by an HTP potentiometer.  Additive subs contribute those levels to the output, whereas inhibitive subs prohibit the channels from outputting any level higher than that determined by the sub.',
'System': 'The term used for all control devices, bridges and receivers connected together on a physical network.',
'System Defaults': 'These are defaults of the current system.  System defaults are accessed in [Setup] from the browser.',
'Template': 'The definition of a moving light or other multi-parameter device. Templates are copied into the current play from the library and may be edited, or created from scratch, within the play.',
'Time Codes': 'MIDI, SMPTE, CD, Real Time, Astro Time, often referred to as Show Control.',
'Timing': 'Time controls the duration of change of the variable parameters of luminaires.  In general, timing information is provided to a cue or cue part [Eos] or sequence step [Congo], although it is possible to provide discrete timing on a parameter basis if required. The “cue time” shall be calculated as the combination of longest delay and longest transition.',
'Timing Disable': 'This feature, when used with a fader Load button, inhibits timing values on the associated fader, allowing playback at full speed.  This is an alternate action command.',
'Timing Template': 'A timing template is stored data that can be used to set selected parameters to predetermined timing values.  Note that these setting are not referenced.  If the template is changed, the parameters previously set with those templates are not altered accordingly.',
'Trace': 'To force a new parameter setting back to either the source of the original move or to a user defined location.',
'Track': 'To force a new parameter setting for selected channels through the cue sheet until a move instruction or block command is encountered.  Track (the alternative is Cue Only) is a desk default, which may be overridden for specific actions using the [Track/Cue Only] button.  Track may be used in conjunction with Record, Record Only and Update and only impacts cues.',
'Track Editing': 'In Congo, for the sequence on the main playback,  UPDATE & ATTRIB will take manual changes and update them into whatever preset sourced the original move. UPDATE & @ LEVEL will update manual intensity changes into presets in that sequence in a forward, backward or both directions until a preset is encountered that contains a different intensity value (for each channel with a change), or until a step with block tracking enabled.',
'Track Lists': 'Track lists are viewers and editors for various types of data. They can be used to view intensity levels and parameter settings across selected channels through an entire sequence, or they can be used to view how a record target is used within a show, or how selected channels are used across a selected record target type.',
'Undo': 'A function that is used to reverse manual control, Record and Delete actions.',
'Update': 'A function that allows manually modified parameters to be re-recorded to record targets.',
'Upfade Time': 'A timing value associated with channel intensity settings.  The up fade time affects the intensity transition in the event the transition is in an upward direction.  The upfade time may have an associated delay time, to postpone the up fade action.',
'Users (designers, programmers)': 'An individual user logged onto one or more face panels to access the show data through a single context.',
'User Preferences': 'Information about a given user that includes the default snapshot, last used context and command stack.',
'User Profile (preferences, defaults)': 'Settings that affect only a specific user, independent of which console that user is using.  The user profile specifies what functions that individual is given access to.',
'Wait Time': 'A wait time is an attribute that can be applied to a sequence step causing the next step to be automatically executed after the wait time has elapsed.  The wait time will begin counting down the moment the associated step is completed. At the moment, in Congo, this timing is set globally as either followon or wait timing.',
'Zero': 'A channel with a level of zero is considered inactive.  It will fade out in the associated cue in the down fade time. Channels may be placed in a zero state during live recording, update operations, or blind operations.  Note there is a difference between a zero instruction and a null value.',
