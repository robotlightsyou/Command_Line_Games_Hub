'''
This program is a command line text game that challenges the user on
their knowledge of ETC Eos terminology.
@TODOS:
* [ ] - weight answers for user comfort/difficulty
* [ ] - add GUI - most likely web inteface
* [ ] - calling list() a lot when genrating answers, would be better for runtime
        to store all values at beginning?
* [ ] - add save file to track user through multiple sessions
        --> started - add file per user? add user folder?
* [ ] - add import deck functions that read a file/webpage and generates
        a new dictionary
* [ ] - create User attribute to track different dictionaries
* [ ] - why is return stats printing None? Why isn't it printing for all cards?
* [ ] - fix play again so that it goes more than one cycle deep
* [ ] - add function so user can choose duration of round
* [ ] - did adding input validation break times answered counter?
* [X] - add try block for input validation in ask_q()
* [X] - completed - change ask_q to be numbers to avoid str coersion
* [X] - completed - Object inheritance is failing, research how to make objects
        sub-object(?) instances nb User.(variable).attribute
* [X] - completed - redefine to also print definition
* [X] - completed - redfine so dictionary name is included in Term object
* [X] - completed - add method(s) to print stats
* [X] - add fake answer check to avoid repeats
* [X} - fix name prompt
* [X] - completed - change ask_q to be numbers to avoid str coersion
  [X] --> timer added, troubleshoot methods
